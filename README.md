# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This project was created so that a user can check the current weather along with a five day forecast for any city. They are presented with the wind speed, humidity, date, and temperature. A list of their recent searches shows up for easy access on the left side of the page.

This project utilizes the openweather API, local Storage, JavaScript, Jquery, and Bootstrap. I learned how to read the documentation for an API, add an icon from an API and style using bootstrap.

## Usage
A user enters a city they would like to visit. They are then presented with the current weather as well as a five day forecast. Their recent searches show up on the left side of the page for easy access.
